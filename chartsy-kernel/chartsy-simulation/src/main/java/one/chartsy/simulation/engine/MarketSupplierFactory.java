 * data sources, enabling the seamless integration of historical playback, real-time feeds, or hybrid market simulations
 * into the broader trading algorithm execution framework.
 * <p>
 * By accepting a {@link PlaybackClock}, the created {@code MarketSupplier} aligns its event timestamps and message sequences
 * precisely with the clockâ€™s simulated time, thereby ensuring temporal consistency and deterministic replayability.
